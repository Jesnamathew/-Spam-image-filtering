# -Spam-image-filtering
Transfer learning-based  spam image filtering
Applying different pre-trained deep learning models, including InceptionV3, Densely Connected Convolutional Networks 121(DenseNet121), Residual Networks (ResNet50), VisualGeometry Group (VGG16) and MobileNetV2, VGG19 to filter out the unwanted spam images.
ResNet50 and VGG 16 yield better performance rather than other models.
Dredze dataset is used in the project
Visual Studio Code is used as Environment.
Html and CSS is used as frontend.
flask code is used to deploy the model.
